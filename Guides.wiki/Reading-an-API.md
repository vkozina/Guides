##Overview
An API (or **Application Program Interface**) is the form of documentation for Java libraries. The [WPILib's API ](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/stable/docs/java/index.html) contains all the built-in classes and methods you have access to when programming your robot. You should reference this anytime you have a question about what a certain class or method is doing.

In general (unless for learning purposes), it is not recommended to try to "reinvent the wheel". This means that if a class or method exists that has the functionality you are looking for, it is best to use it rather than re-write it yourself.

##Layout
An API has a sidebar for easy navigation of packages and classes. You can toggle the view of the sidebar by clicking **FRAMES** and **NO FRAMES**.

Clicking on a class from the sidebar opens the documentation for that class in the center.

Each class has a summary of the fields, constructors and methods. These provide a quick overview of the classes functionality.

For more information, you can click on any of the attributes or scroll down to the appropriate detail section

Method details specify the parameter, return value and purpose of each method a class contains. This can be incredibly helpful when trying to utilize outside libraries.
